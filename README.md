# AlgorithmicGameTheory---Spring2019
The Algorithmic Game Theory course @ Sharif University of Technology ---Spring2019


P1: Linear Programming-> Finding pure Nash equilibrium + "good" (defined in the question) Nash equilibriums. Had to output the probability of playing each of pure actions leading to a MIXED strategy making up a "good" Nash equilibrium.

P2: Linear Programming: Simplyfing a game by deleting its STRICTLY DOMINANT strategies.

P3: Linear Programming: Solving a ZERO-SUM game by finding its all (including MIXED) Nash equilibriums. 

P4: Solving a "RockPaperScissors15 game" against players with different strategies.
